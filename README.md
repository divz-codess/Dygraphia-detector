Dysgraphia is a learning disability and a neurological disorder that is characterized by difficulty with handwriting, spelling, thinking and writing simultaneously and trouble putting thoughts on paper. Dysgraphia causes hand writing to be distorted or incorrect. Children end up making inappropriately sized and spaced letters, or write wrong or misspelled words. Symptoms include:

- Poor letter formation
- Pain and frustration from handwriting
- Difficulty with spacing text
- Poor spelling
- Ungrammatical and disorganized writing
- Avoidance of schoolwork
- Low confidence and a negative self-image
